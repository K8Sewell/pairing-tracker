### Track Pair or Mob Programming Pairs
WIP

# Getting Started

After you clone this repo, you'll want to install all the npm packages using Yarn:

```bash
$ cd ./pairing-tracker
$ yarn install
```
If you get an error about Yarn not being found:

```bash
Command 'yarn' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install cmdtest
```
You can install it with:

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```
Then run ```yarn install``` one more time and then you are ready to start a server to run the application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```
Now you're ready to track your programming pairs!
